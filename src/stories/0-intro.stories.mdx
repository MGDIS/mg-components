# MG Components

## Purpose

MG Components is a reusable component library that helps MGDIS developers build UIs faster.

The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive, framework agnostic and satisfying ;).

This component library use the Atomic Design Methodology to split UI components into small reusable parts.

Components are written in [StencilJS](https://stenciljs.com/), and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df).
It requires [StorybookJS](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Atomic Design

Atomic Design is an interface design method that takes into account the constraints of development.
A few years ago, designers had to create graphics without necessarily taking into account technical design constraints.
Now, it is essential to think about these technical constraints when you create designs for the web.
