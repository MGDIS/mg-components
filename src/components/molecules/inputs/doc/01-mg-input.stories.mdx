# Inputs

## UX

### Label

- The label is located on the left of the input field.
- The text is to be right aligned.
- The label can be on one or more lines.
- The label can be positioned above the input field.

### Input help

The message displayed indicates the format expected by the input field "example: email@provider.com" or "expected format: DD/MM/YYYY (ex: 13/04/2019)"

### Message order

When the messages are displayed under the field the order is as follows:

1. input help
2. error

### Placeholder

The placeholder should not be used as an input help.  
â™¿ RGAA: The placeholder is not considered a valid label under the RGAA so is not subject to a contrast ratio.

### Read only

- The value is no longer editable.
- The input field no longer has a border or background.
- The value is displayed in bold.
- If there is no value entered, nothing is displayed.

### Required field

The asterisk is displayed regardless of the status of the field: input, read-only, disabled.

## Specs

### Placements

The "i" is positioned next to the input field or next to the label when the label is on top.

### Value positioning

By default, the value is left aligned, you can change the CSS variable `--mg-inputs-text-align` to right align.

### Errors

Input field border and error message text are in [@color-danger](?path=/docs/style-colors--page).  
Error message background is a variant of [@color-danger](?path=/docs/style-colors--page) : #FEF6F6 or HSL (357,80%,98%).

## Behavior

### Errors

Error is triggered and displayed when we leave the input field.

When we enter in an input field with an error its state is checked everytime the user update its content, when the error is fixed the message disapears.
